##  Leaderboard Features

### Optimized Ranking Algorithm
The leaderboard uses an advanced ranking system that combines:
- **Total Questions Solved** (LeetCode + Codeforces)
- **LeetCode Contest Rating**
- **Codeforces Rating**

**Formula:**
```
rankScore = (totalQuestions × 10) + (totalRating × 0.25)
```

**Example:** User with 498 questions and 2800 total rating:
- Question Score: 498 × 10 = 4,980 points
- Rating Score: 2,800 × 0.25 = 700 points
- **Final Score: 5,680 points**

For detailed algorithm documentation, see [RANKING_ALGORITHM.md](backend_gcg/RANKING_ALGORITHM.md)
