## 🌐 SaaS Architecture

GCG is built as a **Software as a Service (SaaS)** platform using **Progressive Web App (PWA)** technology:

- **🚀 Zero Installation Barriers** — Users can access instantly via browser or install as a native-like app
- **📱 Cross-Platform** — Single codebase works seamlessly on desktop, mobile, and tablets
- **🔄 Auto-Updates** — Service workers ensure users always have the latest version
- **⚡ Offline Capability** — Continue browsing resources even without internet connection
- **💾 Local Caching** — Fast load times with intelligent caching strategies
- **🌍 Universal Access** — No app store dependencies, accessible worldwide instantly

This PWA-based SaaS approach provides enterprise-grade features with minimal deployment friction, making coding resources accessible to everyone.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Clone the project and launch it on your local machine with ease:

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v18 or newer  
- npm (comes bundled with Node.js)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AyuSharma176/GCG.git
cd GCG
```

### Frontend Setup
```bash
cd GCG_frontend
npm install
```
Create a `.env` file in `GCG_frontend/` with:
```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api/leaderboard
```
Or for production deployment, create a `.env.local` for local development:
```env
# .env.local (not committed to git)
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api/leaderboard
```
Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

**Build for Production (with PWA):**
```bash
npm run build
npm run preview  # Test production build locally
```

### Backend Setup
```bash
cd backend_gcg    # or the actual backend folder
npm install
```
Create a `.env` file in `backend_gcg/` with:
```env
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
PORT=5000
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
```
**Get Your Gemini API Key:**
1. Visit [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Create a new API key
4. Copy and paste into your `.env` file

Start the backend server:
```bash
npm start
```

**Keep Backend Alive (Production):**

For free hosting services like Render that sleep after 15 minutes of inactivity, use [UptimeRobot](https://uptimerobot.com/) to keep the backend awake:

1. Sign up for a free UptimeRobot account
2. Add New Monitor:
   - **Monitor Type:** HTTP(s)
   - **URL:** `https://your-backend-url.com/health`
   - **Monitoring Interval:** 5 minutes
3. The `/health` endpoint will be pinged every 5 minutes, keeping your backend active 24/7

### Environment Variables Setup (Production)

**Vercel (Frontend):**
1. Go to your Vercel project → Settings → Environment Variables
2. Add: `VITE_API_URL` = `https://your-backend-url.com/api/leaderboard`
3. Select all environments (Production, Preview, Development)
4. Redeploy after adding variables

**Render (Backend):**
1. Go to your Render service → Environment
2. Add environment variables:
   - `MONGO_URI` = `your_mongodb_atlas_connection_string`
   - `PORT` = `5000`
   - `GEMINI_API_KEY` = `your_google_gemini_api_key`
3. Service will auto-redeploy with new variables

##  Leaderboard Features

### Optimized Ranking Algorithm
The leaderboard uses an advanced ranking system that combines:
- **Total Questions Solved** (LeetCode + Codeforces)
- **LeetCode Contest Rating**
- **Codeforces Rating**

**Formula:**
```
rankScore = (totalQuestions × 10) + (totalRating × 0.25)
```

**Example:** User with 498 questions and 2800 total rating:
- Question Score: 498 × 10 = 4,980 points
- Rating Score: 2,800 × 0.25 = 700 points
- **Final Score: 5,680 points**

For detailed algorithm documentation, see [RANKING_ALGORITHM.md](backend_gcg/RANKING_ALGORITHM.md)

### API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/leaderboard` | Fetch all users sorted by rank |
| POST | `/api/leaderboard` | Add new user with live stats |
| PUT | `/api/leaderboard/:id/refresh` | Refresh user stats |
| PUT | `/api/leaderboard/refresh-all` | Batch refresh all users |
| DELETE | `/api/leaderboard/:id` | Remove user |
